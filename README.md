# Data-Structures
This was a learning project to understand the various functions of data structures like _**Linked Lists**_ and _**Binary Trees**_. Data structures are one of the most important and useful things that one should know as a programmer(Very popular interview question as well). 

I have implemented the various functions in linked lists and binary trees.

### 1. Linked Lists
* Inserting and deleting a node
* Searching for a node 
* Counting the number of nodes
* Reversing a list
* Merging two linked lists

### 2. Binary trees
* Inserting and deleting a node 
* Displaying the tree inorder, postorder and preorder
* Searching and counting the number of nodes
* Height of the tree
* Printing the path to a node
* Converting the tree to its mirror image
